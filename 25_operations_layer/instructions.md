## Improve code by changing data structure

When creating code to process data, the data structure itself defines (up to a great extent the code itself).
You need to parse the data, maybe sanitize it, process it and export it. A solid data structure, will lead to
better code, more readable, easier to debug and further develop and so on. 

## Challenge

For this challenged you need to refactor the code so that it processes the data as a pandas dataframe, instead 
of converting every measurement into a custom object and then use this data structure (objects) to perform the processing.


## Solution (this should be sent afterwards with your explanation video (if applicable)

By processing the data as a dataframe we rely the parsing and structuring the data to pandas which makes our solution
much simpler.
