## Challenge: Itertools
Python has excellent built in libraries that can simplify many process without you having to re-invent the wheel every time. A great example of this is the itertools package. This has many functionalities for iterating over lists or any other iterable object and performing a variety of operations on the data.

In the code for this challenge, a random list of persons is created. Then, the list of the persons is filtered by age. Finally, a summary is printed that groups the persons by country and shows how many persons live in each country.

Refactor the code in the main function by replacing the for-loops by functions from the `itertools` package.
