## Challenge: Better Discounts
A new feature has been added to the shopping cart system: discounts!

Unfortunately, the developer who coded this (let's call him "Arjan"), didn't do a very good job! He used inheritance to add the discount feature and set things up in such a way that the discount codes and discount handling is all hardcoded in a single method.

You've been hired to redesign the discounts system so that it's easier to add new discount codes on the fly and simplify the code. Feel free to change anything you like in the code, but make sure there's still a `ShoppingCart` class since that's what the customer needs to integrate into their webshop.
