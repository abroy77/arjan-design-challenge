## Challenge: KISS
Every challenge that's part of this program has some code as a starting point. Download the code belonging to this challenge by clicking the Downloads button at the top.

The goal of this challenge is to encourage you to write simple, straightforward, and easy-to-understand code.

You are given a list of strings that represent different types of fruits. You are required to count the frequency of each type of fruit and return a dictionary where the keys are the names of the fruits and the values are their respective counts.

Write a Python function named count_fruits that accomplishes this task in the simplest possible way. Follow the KISS principle to avoid unnecessary complexity in your solution.

After completing the function, write tests to ensure that it's working correctly. You can use Python's built-in unittest package for this, or you can simply add a couple of assertions to the main function.

After you've completed the tasks, reflect on your solution and ask yourself the following questions:

Is your solution as simple as it could be, or is there a simpler approach?
Does your solution use language features and constructs appropriately and effectively?
