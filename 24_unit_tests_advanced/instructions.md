## Refactor the function to simplify testing

Sometimes, it's indeed better to refactor the existing code in order to write (simplified/better) tests. So, forget what 
we said in the previous challenge and try to refactor the previously unchanged `create_event` function so that it's 
testing becomes easier.


## Challenge

For this challenge you will need to further test the API, for edge cases: You should test for at
least the following cases:
-   Event id doesn't exist when getting or deleting an event 
-   There are no more tickets available when buying a ticket


## Solution (this should be sent afterwards with your explanation video (if applicable))

Similar to challenge 6 you need to extend the tests to test the functionality of the edge cases.
