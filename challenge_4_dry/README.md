## Challenge: DRY
The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is a coding principle that aims to reduce repetition in code. It suggests that when writing code, you should avoid duplicating code logic or functionality in multiple places, and instead, create reusable code elements that can be called and reused throughout your codebase.

This particular challenge is a webshop example (download the code by clicking above). There are at least 3 places where there's a lot of code repetition. The challenge is to identify these places and refactor the code so that the repetition is removed.
