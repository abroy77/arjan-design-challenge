## Challenge: OO to Functional
The debate over functional vs object-oriented programming has been ongoing for decades, and both paradigms have their proponents and detractors. At a high level, object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models real-world objects and their relationships, while functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the evaluation of functions and their application to data.

Even though I'm using more and more concepts from the functional paradigm in my own projects, I find that in some cases an object-oriented approach is a better solution. Fortunately for us, Python supports both object-oriented and functional programming!

This challenge is aimed at helping you understand the difference between object-oriented (OO) programming and functional programming. Download the code and take a look. As you can see, the code has been setup as an object-oriented program. There are various `Shape` classes as well as a `ShapeCalculator` class.

Change the code to follow a functional coding style. Make sure the refactored code has the following properties:

* There are zero classes in the new version of the code, you're only allowed to use functions.
* There are zero variables and variable assignments in the new version of the code - arguments to functions are allowed.
